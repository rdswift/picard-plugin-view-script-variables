# View Script Variables

This plugin provides a context menu (right-click) item to display a dialog box listing the metadata tags and variables for the track / file.

This allows you to see metadata variables beginning with "~" which are not normally visible in the metadata pane of the main Picard window, which can be useful when you are writing tagging or file naming scripts.

**Note:** This plugin was developed by Sophist, and has been converted to Picard v3 format by Bob Swift.
